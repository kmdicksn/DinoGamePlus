# DinoGamePlus
A faithful recreation of the classic no-internet dinosaur game on Chrome in Python, with some tweaks.

# Bugs
* The cactus and pterodactyls spawning can sometimes create instances where it is impossible to jump over, need to rework spawning algorithm.
* The hitbox for the dinosaur is currently a little too large, need to adjust.
